"""
Pipeline hook - imported by all collectors.

COLLECTOR PATTERN (unchanged - all existing collectors work without modification):
    db.add(Detection(...))
    ...
    await db.commit()
    await trigger_pipeline_for_new(db)   ← fires pipeline for all new detections

The pipeline itself handles:
    routing -> finding merge/create -> enrichment -> attribution -> campaign -> exposure -> action -> dispatch

DEDUPLICATION: Handled in the pipeline at Step 3 (finding_manager.get_or_create_finding).
Collectors do NOT need to call dedup manually. The finding layer absorbs duplicates -
same IOC from two sources becomes one Finding with source_count=2.

The old route_and_dedup_before_commit is kept for backward compat but now just
delegates to the pipeline. Don't use it in new collectors.
