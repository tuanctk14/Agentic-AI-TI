"""
Dark Web Triage Agent - Autonomous Classification & Action
============================================================
WHAT: When a DarkWebMention with customer_id is inserted, this agent:
      1. Reads full title/metadata
      2. AI classifies: extortion | data_leak | credential_sale | noise
      3. For critical types, auto-creates a CRITICAL Finding with playbook
      4. For noise, flags so it doesn't clutter dashboard

WHY:  insert_darkweb() currently does a plain INSERT and nothing else.
      The Dark Web tab is a dead list. No workflow triggers. No alerts.
      This agent makes dark web mentions actionable.

TRIGGERED BY: Celery task after DarkWebMention insert with customer_id
